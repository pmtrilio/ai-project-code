/**
 * Represents a single database table.
 *
 * Exposes methods for retrieving data out of it, and manages the associations
 * this table has to other tables. Multiple instances of this class can be created
 * for the same database table with different aliases, this allows you to address
 * your database structure in a richer and more expressive way.
 *
 * ### Retrieving data
 *
 * The primary way to retrieve data is using Table::find(). See that method
 * for more information.
 *
 * ### Dynamic finders
 *
 * In addition to the standard find($type) finder methods, CakePHP provides dynamic
 * finder methods. These methods allow you to easily set basic conditions up. For example
 * to filter users by username you would call
 *
 * ```
 * $query = $users->findByUsername('mark');
 * ```
 *
 * You can also combine conditions on multiple fields using either `Or` or `And`:
 *
 * ```
 * $query = $users->findByUsernameOrEmail('mark', 'mark@example.org');
 * ```
 *
 * ### Bulk updates/deletes
 *
 * You can use Table::updateAll() and Table::deleteAll() to do bulk updates/deletes.
 * You should be aware that events will *not* be fired for bulk updates/deletes.
 *
 * ### Events
 *
 * Table objects emit several events during as life-cycle hooks during find, delete and save
 * operations. All events use the CakePHP event package:
 *
 * - `Model.beforeFind` Fired before each find operation. By stopping the event and
 *   supplying a return value you can bypass the find operation entirely. Any
 *   changes done to the $query instance will be retained for the rest of the find. The
