/**
 * Implements methods for HTTP responses.
 *
 * All the following examples assume that `$response` is an
 * instance of this class.
 *
 * ### Get header values
 *
 * Header names are case-insensitive, but normalized to Title-Case
 * when the response is parsed.
 *
 * ```
 * $val = $response->getHeaderLine('content-type');
 * ```
 *
 * Will read the Content-Type header. You can get all set
 * headers using:
 *
 * ```
 * $response->getHeaders();
 * ```
 *
 * ### Get the response body
 *
 * You can access the response body stream using:
 *
 * ```
 * $content = $response->getBody();
 * ```
 *
 * You can get the body string using:
 *
 * ```
 * $content = $response->getStringBody();
 * ```
 *
 * If your response body is in XML or JSON you can use
 * special content type specific accessors to read the decoded data.
 * JSON data will be returned as arrays, while XML data will be returned
 * as SimpleXML nodes:
 *
 * ```
 * // Get as XML
 * $content = $response->getXml()
 * // Get as JSON
 * $content = $response->getJson()
 * ```
 *
 * If the response cannot be decoded, null will be returned.
 *
 * ### Check the status code
 *
 * You can access the response status code using:
 *
 * ```
 * $content = $response->getStatusCode();
