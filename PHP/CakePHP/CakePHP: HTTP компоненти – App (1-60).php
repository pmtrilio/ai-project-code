/**
 * App is responsible for resource location, and path management.
 *
 * ### Adding paths
 *
 * Additional paths for Templates and Plugins are configured with Configure now. See config/app.php for an
 * example. The `App.paths.plugins` and `App.paths.templates` variables are used to configure paths for plugins
 * and templates respectively. All class based resources should be mapped using your application's autoloader.
 *
 * ### Inspecting loaded paths
 *
 * You can inspect the currently loaded paths using `App::classPath('Controller')` for example to see loaded
 * controller paths.
 *
 * It is also possible to inspect paths for plugin classes, for instance, to get
 * the path to a plugin's helpers you would call `App::classPath('View/Helper', 'MyPlugin')`
 *
 * ### Locating plugins
 *
 * Plugins can be located with App as well. Using Plugin::path('DebugKit') for example, will
 * give you the full path to the DebugKit plugin.
