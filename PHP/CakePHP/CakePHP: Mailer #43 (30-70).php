 * Mailer classes let you encapsulate related Email logic into a reusable
 * and testable class.
 *
 * ## Defining Messages
 *
 * Mailers make it easy for you to define methods that handle email formatting
 * logic. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * class UserMailer extends Mailer
 * {
 *     public function resetPassword($user)
 *     {
 *         $this
 *             ->setSubject('Reset Password')
 *             ->setTo($user->email)
 *             ->set(['token' => $user->token]);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Is a trivial example but shows how a mailer could be declared.
 *
 * ## Sending Messages
 *
 * After you have defined some messages you will want to send them:
 *
 * ```
 * $mailer = new UserMailer();
 * $mailer->send('resetPassword', $user);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Event Listener
 *
 * Mailers can also subscribe to application event allowing you to
 * decouple email delivery from your application code. By re-declaring the
 * `implementedEvents()` method you can define event handlers that can
 * convert events into email. For example, if your application had a user
 * registration event:
 *
 * ```
