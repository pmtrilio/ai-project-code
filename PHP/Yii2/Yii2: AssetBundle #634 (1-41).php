/**
 * AssetBundle represents a collection of asset files, such as CSS, JS, images.
 *
 * Each asset bundle has a unique name that globally identifies it among all asset bundles used in an application.
 * The name is the [fully qualified class name](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.rules.php)
 * of the class representing it.
 *
 * An asset bundle can depend on other asset bundles. When registering an asset bundle
 * with a view, all its dependent asset bundles will be automatically registered.
 *
 * For more details and usage information on AssetBundle, see the [guide article on assets](guide:structure-assets).
