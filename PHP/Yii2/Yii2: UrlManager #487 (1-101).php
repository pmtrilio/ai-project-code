/**
 * UrlManager handles HTTP request parsing and creation of URLs based on a set of rules.
 *
 * UrlManager is configured as an application component in [[\yii\base\Application]] by default.
 * You can access that instance via `Yii::$app->urlManager`.
 *
 * You can modify its configuration by adding an array to your application config under `components`
 * as it is shown in the following example:
 *
 * ```
 * 'urlManager' => [
 *     'enablePrettyUrl' => true,
 *     'rules' => [
 *         // your rules go here
 *     ],
 *     // ...
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * Rules are classes implementing the [[UrlRuleInterface]], by default that is [[UrlRule]].
 * For nesting rules, there is also a [[GroupUrlRule]] class.
 *
 * For more details and usage information on UrlManager, see the [guide article on routing](guide:runtime-routing).
 *
 * @property string $baseUrl The base URL that is used by [[createUrl()]] to prepend to created URLs.
 * @property string $hostInfo The host info (e.g. `https://www.example.com`) that is used by
 * [[createAbsoluteUrl()]] to prepend to created URLs.
 * @property string $scriptUrl The entry script URL that is used by [[createUrl()]] to prepend to created
 * URLs.

    /**
     * @var array the rules for creating and parsing URLs when [[enablePrettyUrl]] is `true`.
     * This property is used only if [[enablePrettyUrl]] is `true`. Each element in the array
     * is the configuration array for creating a single URL rule. The configuration will
     * be merged with [[ruleConfig]] first before it is used for creating the rule object.
     *
     * A special shortcut format can be used if a rule only specifies [[UrlRule::pattern|pattern]]
     * and [[UrlRule::route|route]]: `'pattern' => 'route'`. That is, instead of using a configuration
     * array, one can use the key to represent the pattern and the value the corresponding route.
     * For example, `'post/<id:\d+>' => 'post/view'`.
     *
     * For RESTful routing the mentioned shortcut format also allows you to specify the
     * [[UrlRule::verb|HTTP verb]] that the rule should apply for.
     * You can do that  by prepending it to the pattern, separated by space.
     * For example, `'PUT post/<id:\d+>' => 'post/update'`.
     * You may specify multiple verbs by separating them with comma
     * like this: `'POST,PUT post/index' => 'post/create'`.
     * The supported verbs in the shortcut format are: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.
     * Note that [[UrlRule::mode|mode]] will be set to PARSING_ONLY when specifying verb in this way
     * so you normally would not specify a verb for normal GET request.
     *
     * Here is an example configuration for RESTful CRUD controller:
     *
     * ```
     * [
     *     'dashboard' => 'site/index',
     *
     *     'POST <controller:[\w-]+>' => '<controller>/create',
     *     '<controller:[\w-]+>s' => '<controller>/index',
     *
     *     'PUT <controller:[\w-]+>/<id:\d+>'    => '<controller>/update',
     *     'DELETE <controller:[\w-]+>/<id:\d+>' => '<controller>/delete',
     *     '<controller:[\w-]+>/<id:\d+>'        => '<controller>/view',
     * ];
     * ```
