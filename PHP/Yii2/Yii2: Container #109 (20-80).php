/**
 * Container implements a [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) container.
 *
 * A dependency injection (DI) container is an object that knows how to instantiate and configure objects and
 * all their dependent objects. For more information about DI, please refer to
 * [Martin Fowler's article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html).
 *
 * Container supports constructor injection as well as property injection.
 *
 * To use Container, you first need to set up the class dependencies by calling [[set()]].
 * You then call [[get()]] to create a new class object. The Container will automatically instantiate
 * dependent objects, inject them into the object being created, configure, and finally return the newly created object.
 *
 * By default, [[\Yii::$container]] refers to a Container instance which is used by [[\Yii::createObject()]]
 * to create new object instances. You may use this method to replace the `new` operator
 * when creating a new object, which gives you the benefit of automatic dependency resolution and default
 * property configuration.
 *
 * Below is an example of using Container:
 *
 * ```
 * namespace app\models;
 *
 * use yii\base\BaseObject;
 * use yii\db\Connection;
 * use yii\di\Container;
 *
 * interface UserFinderInterface
 * {
 *     function findUser();
 * }
 *
 * class UserFinder extends BaseObject implements UserFinderInterface
 * {
 *     public $db;
 *
 *     public function __construct(Connection $db, $config = [])
 *     {
 *         $this->db = $db;
 *         parent::__construct($config);
 *     }
 *
 *     public function findUser()
 *     {
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * class UserLister extends BaseObject
 * {
 *     public $finder;
 *
 *     public function __construct(UserFinderInterface $finder, $config = [])
 *     {
 *         $this->finder = $finder;
 *         parent::__construct($config);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * $container = new Container;
 * $container->set('yii\db\Connection', [
 *     'dsn' => '...',
