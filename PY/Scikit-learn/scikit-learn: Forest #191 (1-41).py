"""
Forest of trees-based ensemble methods.

Those methods include random forests and extremely randomized trees.

The module structure is the following:

- The ``BaseForest`` base class implements a common ``fit`` method for all
  the estimators in the module. The ``fit`` method of the base ``Forest``
  class calls the ``fit`` method of each sub-estimator on random samples
  (with replacement, a.k.a. bootstrap) of the training set.

  The init of the sub-estimator is further delegated to the
  ``BaseEnsemble`` constructor.

- The ``ForestClassifier`` and ``ForestRegressor`` base classes further
  implement the prediction logic by computing an average of the predicted
  outcomes of the sub-estimators.

- The ``RandomForestClassifier`` and ``RandomForestRegressor`` derived
  classes provide the user with concrete implementations of
  the forest ensemble method using classical, deterministic
  ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` and ``DecisionTreeRegressor`` as
  sub-estimator implementations.

- The ``ExtraTreesClassifier`` and ``ExtraTreesRegressor`` derived
  classes provide the user with concrete implementations of the
  forest ensemble method using the extremely randomized trees
  ``ExtraTreeClassifier`` and ``ExtraTreeRegressor`` as
  sub-estimator implementations.

Single and multi-output problems are both handled.
