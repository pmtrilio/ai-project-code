    "Common" middleware for taking care of some basic operations:

        - Forbid access to User-Agents in settings.DISALLOWED_USER_AGENTS

        - URL rewriting: Based on the APPEND_SLASH and PREPEND_WWW settings,
          append missing slashes and/or prepends missing "www."s.

            - If APPEND_SLASH is set and the initial URL doesn't end with a
              slash, and it is not found in urlpatterns, form a new URL by
              appending a slash at the end. If this new URL is found in
              urlpatterns, return an HTTP redirect to this new URL; otherwise
              process the initial URL as usual.

          This behavior can be customized by subclassing CommonMiddleware and
          overriding the response_redirect_class attribute.
