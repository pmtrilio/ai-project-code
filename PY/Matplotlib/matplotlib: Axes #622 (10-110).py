    Patch the qualname for functions that are directly added to Axes.

    Some Axes functionality is defined in functions in other submodules.
    These are simply added as attributes to Axes. As a result, their
    ``__qualname__`` is e.g. only "table" and not "Axes.table". This
    function fixes that.

    Note that the function itself is patched, so that
    ``matplotlib.table.table.__qualname__` will also show "Axes.table".
    However, since these functions are not intended to be standalone,
    this is bearable.

    An Axes object encapsulates all the elements of an individual (sub-)plot in
    a figure.

    It contains most of the (sub-)plot elements: `~.axis.Axis`,
    `~.axis.Tick`, `~.lines.Line2D`, `~.text.Text`, `~.patches.Polygon`, etc.,
    and sets the coordinate system.

    Like all visible elements in a figure, Axes is an `.Artist` subclass.

    The `Axes` instance supports callbacks through a callbacks attribute which
    is a `~.cbook.CallbackRegistry` instance.  The events you can connect to
    are 'xlim_changed' and 'ylim_changed' and the callback will be called with
    func(*ax*) where *ax* is the `Axes` instance.

    .. note::

        As a user, you do not instantiate Axes directly, but use Axes creation
        methods instead; e.g. from `.pyplot` or `.Figure`:
        `~.pyplot.subplots`, `~.pyplot.subplot_mosaic` or `.Figure.add_axes`.
