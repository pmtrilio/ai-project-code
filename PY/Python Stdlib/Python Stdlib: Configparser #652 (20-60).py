             empty_lines_in_values=True, default_section='DEFAULT',
             interpolation=<unset>, converters=<unset>,
             allow_unnamed_section=False):
        Create the parser. When `defaults` is given, it is initialized into the
        dictionary or intrinsic defaults. The keys must be strings, the values
        must be appropriate for %()s string interpolation.

        When `dict_type` is given, it will be used to create the dictionary
        objects for the list of sections, for the options within a section, and
        for the default values.

        When `delimiters` is given, it will be used as the set of substrings
        that divide keys from values.

        When `comment_prefixes` is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in empty lines. Comments can be
        indented.

        When `inline_comment_prefixes` is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in non-empty lines.

        When `strict` is True, the parser won't allow for any section or option
        duplicates while reading from a single source (file, string or
        dictionary). Default is True.

        When `empty_lines_in_values` is False (default: True), each empty line
        marks the end of an option. Otherwise, internal empty lines of
        a multiline option are kept as part of the value.

        When `allow_no_value` is True (default: False), options without
        values are accepted; the value presented for these is None.

        When `default_section` is given, the name of the special section is
        named accordingly. By default it is called ``"DEFAULT"`` but this can
        be customized to point to any other valid section name. Its current
        value can be retrieved using the ``parser_instance.default_section``
        attribute and may be modified at runtime.

        When `interpolation` is given, it should be an Interpolation subclass
        instance. It will be used as the handler for option value
        pre-processing when using getters. RawConfigParser objects don't do
