    'attributes' - a Python dictionary storing the element's attributes.

    'text' - a string containing the element's text content.

    'tail' - an optional string containing text after the element's end tag.

    And a number of child elements stored in a Python sequence.

 To create an element instance, use the Element constructor,
 or the SubElement factory function.

 You can also use the ElementTree class to wrap an element structure
 and convert it to and from XML.
