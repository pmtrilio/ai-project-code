    Return the *attrs* attribute values of *inst* as a dict.

    Optionally recurse into other *attrs*-decorated classes.

    Args:
        inst: Instance of an *attrs*-decorated class.

        recurse (bool): Recurse into classes that are also *attrs*-decorated.

        filter (~typing.Callable):
            A callable whose return code determines whether an attribute or
            element is included (`True`) or dropped (`False`).  Is called with
            the `attrs.Attribute` as the first argument and the value as the
            second argument.

        dict_factory (~typing.Callable):
            A callable to produce dictionaries from.  For example, to produce
            ordered dictionaries instead of normal Python dictionaries, pass in
            ``collections.OrderedDict``.

        retain_collection_types (bool):
            Do not convert to `list` when encountering an attribute whose type
            is `tuple` or `set`.  Only meaningful if *recurse* is `True`.

        value_serializer (typing.Callable | None):
            A hook that is called for every attribute or dict key/value.  It
            receives the current instance, field and value and must return the
            (updated) value.  The hook is run *after* the optional *filter* has
            been applied.

    Returns:
        Return type of *dict_factory*.

    Raises:
        attrs.exceptions.NotAnAttrsClassError:
            If *cls* is not an *attrs* class.
