class Response(_SansIOResponse):
    """Represents an outgoing WSGI HTTP response with body, status, and
    headers. Has properties and methods for using the functionality
    defined by various HTTP specs.

    The response body is flexible to support different use cases. The
    simple form is passing bytes, or a string which will be encoded as
    UTF-8. Passing an iterable of bytes or strings makes this a
    streaming response. A generator is particularly useful for building
    a CSV file in memory or using SSE (Server Sent Events). A file-like
    object is also iterable, although the
    :func:`~werkzeug.utils.send_file` helper should be used in that
    case.

    The response object is itself a WSGI application callable. When
    called (:meth:`__call__`) with ``environ`` and ``start_response``,
    it will pass its status and headers to ``start_response`` then
    return its body as an iterable.

    :param response: The data for the body of the response. A string or
        bytes, or tuple or list of strings or bytes, for a fixed-length
        response, or any other iterable of strings or bytes for a
        streaming response. Defaults to an empty body.
    :param status: The status code for the response. Either an int, in
        which case the default status message is added, or a string in
