    Return the *attrs* attribute values of *inst* as a dict.

    Optionally recurse into other *attrs*-decorated classes.

    Args:
        inst: Instance of an *attrs*-decorated class.

        recurse (bool): Recurse into classes that are also *attrs*-decorated.

        filter (~typing.Callable):
            A callable whose return code determines whether an attribute or
            element is included (`True`) or dropped (`False`).  Is called with
            the `attrs.Attribute` as the first argument and the value as the
            second argument.
