    // This value type represents a date and time.  Every DateTime
    // object has a private field (Ticks) of type Int64 that stores the
    // date and time as the number of 100 nanosecond intervals since
    // 12:00 AM January 1, year 1 A.D. in the proleptic Gregorian Calendar.
    //
    // Starting from V2.0, DateTime also stored some context about its time
    // zone in the form of a 3-state value representing Unspecified, Utc or
    // Local. This is stored in the two top bits of the 64-bit numeric value
    // with the remainder of the bits storing the tick count. This information
    // is only used during time zone conversions and is not part of the
    // identity of the DateTime. Thus, operations like Compare and Equals
    // ignore this state. This is to stay compatible with earlier behavior
    // and performance characteristics and to avoid forcing  people into dealing
    // with the effects of daylight savings. Note, that this has little effect
    // on how the DateTime works except in a context where its specific time
    // zone is needed, such as during conversions and some parsing and formatting
    // cases.
    //
    // There is also 4th state stored that is a special type of Local value that
    // is used to avoid data loss when round-tripping between local and UTC time.
    // See below for more information on this 4th state, although it is
    // effectively hidden from most users, who just see the 3-state DateTimeKind
    // enumeration.
    //
    // For compatibility, DateTime does not serialize the Kind data when used in
    // binary serialization.
