        /// associated with them. The cache uses WeakReferences to refer to the metadata readers and
        /// AssemblySymbols to allow memory and resources being reclaimed once they are no longer
        /// used. The tricky part about reusing existing AssemblySymbols is to find a set of
        /// AssemblySymbols that are created for the referenced assemblies, which (the
        /// AssemblySymbols from the set) are linked in a way, consistent with the reference
        /// resolution between the referenced assemblies.

        /// When existing Compilation is used as a metadata reference, there are scenarios when its
        /// underlying SourceAssemblySymbol cannot be used to provide symbols in context of the new
        /// Compilation. Consider classic multi-targeting scenario: compilation C1 references v1 of
        /// Lib.dll and compilation C2 references C1 and v2 of Lib.dll. In this case,
        /// SourceAssemblySymbol for C1 is linked to AssemblySymbol for v1 of Lib.dll. However,

        /// v2 of Lib.dll. In other words, in context of C2, all types from v1 of Lib.dll leaking
        /// through C1 (through method signatures, etc.) must be retargeted to the types from v2 of
        /// Lib.dll. In this case, ReferenceManager creates a special RetargetingAssemblySymbol for
        /// C1, which is responsible for the type retargeting. The RetargetingAssemblySymbols could
        /// also be reused for different Compilations, ReferenceManager maintains a cache of
        /// RetargetingAssemblySymbols (WeakReferences) for each Compilation.
